            <div class="aboutme">Hello, my name is Yulia! I am a geology engineer in the past and was working on mines for several years on the middle of nowhere, then I decided that it is enough and I switched my work on the beautiful side of the industry and become a jeweler. This was fun time but with no money. My clear understang that I have to stop playing around and just want to have a normal job when I had a babygirl.

        I am a struggled programmer and trying to make my way through universe of codes. My first computer I had at 20 years old and only what I remember from programming classes is a blue screen and white letters. Late I took several web classes for design porpouse but then I understood that my engineering soul is nocking from my brain and saying: "who cares about this colors... we need to do some action!". I like  <a  class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com" target="blank">Youtube</a> because there are bunch of free audio books, lessons, tutoring and documentaries.</p>
